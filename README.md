## VALORANT Process Disabler

**VALORANT Process Disabler** is a Python utility designed to help users manage and disable specific VALORANT-related processes and services on Windows. This tool is particularly useful for those looking to disable the `RiotClientServices.exe`, `RiotClientCrashHandler.exe`, and `vgtray.exe` processes, as well as the `Riot Vanguard` service, ensuring they do not run at startup.

### Features:
- **Terminate Processes:** Automatically detects and terminates VALORANT-related processes (`RiotClientServices.exe`, `RiotClientCrashHandler.exe`, `vgtray.exe`).
- **Disable Autostart:** Removes the `Riot Vanguard` entry from the Windows registry to prevent it from starting automatically.
- **Manage Services:** Modifies the `vgc` service's startup type in the registry, disabling it to prevent it from running.
- **User Feedback:** Provides detailed feedback on the status of processes and registry entries, including confirmation of changes made.

### How to Use:
1. **Run as Administrator:** Ensure the script is run with administrative privileges to modify system processes and registry entries.
2. **Monitor Feedback:** Follow the on-screen prompts to see which processes are running and which registry entries have been modified.
3. **Hit Enter to Close:** After all tasks are completed, simply press Enter to close the script.

This script is ideal for users who want more control over VALORANT's background processes and services. Whether you're troubleshooting or optimizing your system, VALORANT Sentinel provides a straightforward solution.
**RUN THIS EVERYTIME YOU CLOSE THE GAME SINCE VALORANT TURNS BACK ON RIOT VANGUARD IN REGISTRY !
